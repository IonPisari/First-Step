         Croatia

         
    </h1>
    <p><b> A couple of decades ago, most people associated Croatia with the brutal 
        Balkan Wars that ravaged the region until 1995. But in the last ten years, 
        the country has become a hot spot for tourism, getting a ton of attention 
        from travel magazines and influencers and a surge of visitors 
        (<i>thanks to Game of Thrones</i>).</b></p>

                <p>Compared to other European capitals, Zagreb is underrated and underappreciated. 
                    Its charming Old Town is lined with narrow cobblestone streets flanked
                    by Gothic churches and Baroque palaces.It’s full of quirky museums and lots of green space. 
                    With its pedestrian-only streets and plentiful trams, I often felt I was in Amsterdam.
                    A lot of travelers skip it, but I wouldn’t suggest that. Spend at least three days there.

                    <br>
                    Don’t miss the Museum of Broken Relationships, the Hangover Museum, and the Botanical Gardens.
                    Make sure to take the free walking tour and Secret Zagreb’s spooky history tour. 
                    Also, be sure to visit the Dolac Market for cheap eats, and enjoy all the wine you can drink. 
                    For a day trip, head to Jarun Lake (just 8km/5 miles from the city center) to swim or kayak when the weather gets warm.</p>

                <p>
                    With over a thousand islands along the coast, it would be silly to travel to Croatia and not go island-hopping. 
                    One of the best hubs for this is Split. From there you can jump on a boat and go anywhere on the central Dalmatian coast.
                    The most popular islands are Brac, Hvar, Krk, Cres, and Lošinj, but don’t be afraid to go further afield and explore
                    some of the lesser-known ones, such as Silba, Vis, and Lastovo. Most have ferries that cost less than 40 HRK each way.

                    <br>
                    Or you could charter a boat or do a hop-on, hop-off boat tour. Charters can get pricey though, as a seven-day trip starts
                    at 13,000–15,000 HRK. If you’re in the mood for partying, Busabout has hop-on-hop-off boat tours. I did one a few years ago
                    (you can read about it here). For a seven- or eight-day trip, expect to pay 9,500 HRK. During the high season, prices rise dramatically, 
                    but if you go during the shoulder season, you can find some great deals.
